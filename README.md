Restaurant project from TOP

27 Sept 2021:
Website base functionality is coded in javascript, but I have (VERY obviously) done nothing with design yet.

28 Sept 2021:
Some functionality extensions:
	'Menu' page is created by parsing a JSON file for each menu item, then displaying it on the page. I felt this made the most sense for creating a page like this with future additions or changes in mind.
	Some bug fixes when switching between pages

Basic design changes:
	Added a custom font and specified other font families
	Added margins and padding to open the page up some more
	Resized the images manually prior to adding them to src/ so they would not appear extremely distored while having a single, consistent image size (plus: rounded corners!)
